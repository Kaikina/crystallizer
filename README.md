# Crystallizer

Crystallizer is a mod that adds to the game a block called "Crystallizer". It's a decorative block that allows the
player to crystallize ores such as : iron, copper, gold, quartz, emerald and diamond. The block needs to be Redstone
powered to start crystallizing. The crystallizing process means that it will generate an infinite amount of the 
crystallizing ore.

### Documentation

#### Recipe
The crystallizer can be crafted with : 
```
I H I
I N I
L H L
```
Where :
- I : Iron Block
- H : Hopper
- N : Netherite Block
- L : Lapis Block

#### Crystallizing
To select which ore you want to crystallize, you can open the GUI and insert your ore (Careful, only input 1), or
right-click the block with the ore in your hand. The ore is instantly consumed by the Crystallizer. To start 
crystallizing your ore, the Crystallizer need to be Redstone powered. Once powered it will start crystallizing.

#### Crystallizing times
Every ore as its own crystallizing time, as follows : 
- Iron : 2 min
- Copper : 2 min
- Quartz : 2 min
- Gold : 30 min
- Diamond : 40 min
- Emerald : 40 min
